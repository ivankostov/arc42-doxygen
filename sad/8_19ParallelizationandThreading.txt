\page ParallelizationandThreading Parallelization and Threading

Applications can be executed in parallel processes or threads.
This creates a need for synchronization points. The theory of parallel processing serves as a foundation for this aspect.
The architecture and implementation of parallel systems needs to consider many technical details such as address spaces, 
applied mechanisms for synchronization – guards, semaphores, etc. – processes and threads, parallelism in the operating system, 
parallelism in virtual machines. etc.
