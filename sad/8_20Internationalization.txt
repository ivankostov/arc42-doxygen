This section covers support for usage of the system in different countries, 
i.e. adjusting the system to country specific attributes. Internationalization
 (often abbreviated as “i18n” where “18” refers to the eighteen characters between the I and the n) covers translation of text, 
 usage of character encodings, display of fonts, writing of numbers and dates, and other (external) aspects.
