\page Security Security

The security of software systems deals with mechanisms that ensure data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
Typical issues are:
- How can data be protected during transport (e.g. via open networks such as the internet)?
- How can communicating entities ensure mutual trust?
- How can communicating entities identify each other and be protected against faked identities?
- How can communicating entities prove data provenience or certify validity of data?


The topic of IT-security often touches upon legal aspects, sometimes even international law.
