/**
\page GenericStructures Recurring or Generic Structures and Patterns

\b Motivation

Sometimes a hierarchical decomposition of building blocks is insufficient for giving an overview of detailed interdependencies between individual building blocks. 
The following sections are intended to describe generic or specific dependencies among any set of building blocks â€“ possibly even across different levels.
We call a dependency generic if it appears more than once in the architecture, and specific if it is unique.

\b Form
Use building block models (class diagrams, package diagrams, component diagrams, etc.) and related descriptions in the same way as in the hierarchical decomposition.
Often it is practical to support understandability by adding specific runtime views to explain these recurring structures.
