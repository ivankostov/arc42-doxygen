/**
\page ErrorHandling Exception/Error Handling

How are exceptions and errors handled systematically and consistently?
How can the system reach a consistent state after an error? Is this done automatically or is manual interaction required?
This aspect is also related to logging and tracing,
Which kind of exceptions and errors are handled by the system? Which kinds of errors are forwarded to which external interface and which are handled fully internally?
How do you use the exception handling mechanisms of your programming language? Do you use checked or unchecked exceptions?
