\page Configurability Configurability

The flexibility of a software system is influenced by its configurability,
i.e. the possibility to make certain decisions about usage of the system at a late point in time.
Configurability can occur at the following events:
- During development: For example server, file, or directory names could be stored directly in the code (“hard-coded”).
- During deployment or installation: Configuration information for a specific installation (such as the installation path) can be given.
- At system startup: Information can be read dynamically before or during system startup.
- During application execution: Configuration information is queried or read during runtime.
