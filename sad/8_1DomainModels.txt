\b Contents
 
Business (or logical) models, domain models - they all describe subject-specific, business aspects, without relation to technology.
Often these structures or concepts are re-used at many places within an architecture, especially within chapter 5. Building Block View..

\b Motivation

Often parts of these models reappear in the building block view, but in order to „keep them clean from technnology“ they can be captured as a concept. 

\b Form

Usually either ER-Models (Entity-Relationship Models) or UML class diagrams (mainly containing entity classes) are used to document domain models.
